        Please have below my two beautiful babies, Crash and Elliot. Crash is 6 years old, and Elliot is 10 months old. Both are lovely and really great companions for every activity, 
        both loyal and playful. When having zooming moments, please be careful. You do not want a 54Kg dog running over you; you will go directly to the hospital. 
        Besides, Elliot being normal regular size with his 21Kg, he will bite your arms like a hungry piranha. In other words, have puppies; they will make your life better but your wallet cry, 
        just details.
